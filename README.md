You can find more info about the app and a downloadable android version [here](https://binarynonsense.itch.io/helos-cheatsheet).


## Build Notes

Android: If you want to build a release version, you need to copy your release.keystore file to /android/app
and create a release.keystore.properties file in /android with the required information (see the release.keystore.properties.sample file for an example)

IOS: I don't own any Apple devices so I haven't built or tested an IOS version.
